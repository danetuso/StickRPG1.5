# Stick RPG1.5
### Created using JTwoD Engine

**Special thanks to XGen Studios for their awesome work over the years!**

This game was created to get me reinspired in Java game code, as well as help along the development of the JTwoD Engine, found here: 
[JTwoD](https://github.com/nathan-fiscaletti/jtwod)


As of now, all the resources are taken from the original game, but my own original content will be soon to come!

The rest of the project with a build script so others can play will come soon!

Special thanks to Nathan Fiscaletti for the help!
